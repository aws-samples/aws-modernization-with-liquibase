## Welcome

In this workshop, you will gain hands-on experience deploying database changes using Liquibase Pro. 

Liquibase Pro is a database DevOps solution that allows organizations to accelerate, secure, observe, and govern their database change pipelines. By completing this workshop, you’ll learn how to establish automated database CI/CD pipelines that monitor and re-enforce data governance policies and allow your developers to shift left by catching errors before they cause slowdowns or deployment failures. You’ll also learn how to add data governance with Quality Checks, a feature of Liquibase Pro that allows you to identify changes that could present undesired risk or practices that violate data governance policy or organization standards.
